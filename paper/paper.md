# Abstract

In a world of finance, it is increasingly necessary to obtain programming skillsets that prepare one do technical analysis.  To excel at one's profession of choice as an academic or in industry, programming knowledge and experience proves to be an essential skill.  Comparable to any other skillset, there is a lot to know.  The objective of this project is to study and develop a strong skillset in a specific area of computational methods in order to assist my future employer, Equity Methods.  Through implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP) and specific design patterns in Python, we can develop a pricing engine for as many types of options as deemed necessary.  Using these methods in cases from Black Scholes pricing to Monte Carlo analysis, help improve computational speed and can simplify the code necessary.  The results of this project will show a dynamic, yet simple, interface for the end-user, and they will show how benefits of implementing OOP.

# Introduction

- Brief Background of me/why decided to do this project or EM?
- Things I did?  (maybe part of abstract?)
- I will be able to roll this concept and even possibly the implementation over to my job directly
- All the different ways this is possible?  More than one, and tell about the the methods implemented
- Explain the importance of why? (lead into next PP)

## Why Object-Oriented Programming for Options Pricing?

- What benefits OOP provides. -- Take from notes of textbooks and references made on certain patterns.
- Working at Equity Methods, where the company helps clients model, value, and account for equity compensation instruments and other complex securities I will implement what I've learned in object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques to help the company increase overall efficiency.
- For instance, EM designs, values, provides audit support, and continually tracks Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) awards, which can be very unique depending on circumstances.  Although unique, there are multiple common steps and concepts that can be combined using OOP and design patterns to increase the efficiency.
- Maybe a few more examples of EM's services and how it would benefit from OOP or why it benefits me to learn OOP.
- Standard in the programming world.

## Overview of Monte Carlo Methods

- Benefits of MC - why is it so useful.  why even use it?  Where is the power?
- 

### A Naive Monte Carlo Pricer
- More in depth


### Variance Reduction Techniques

- How can I implement Variance Reduction Techniques to imrove work, and why are these important in the case of EM.

#### Antithetic Sampling - 
- Example?

#### Stratified Sampling
- Example

#### Control Variate Sampling


## The Monte Carlo Pricing Engine


## The Tree Pricing Engine
- show the design patterns interweaving the system.  UML?


## What Else?
- UML 
- Endless possibilities and variations.

# Introduction


## Why Object-Oriented Programming for Options Pricing?

- What benefits OOP provides.
- Working at Equity Methods, where the company helps clients model, value, and account for equity compensation instruments and other complex securities I will implement what I've learned in object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques to help the company increase overall efficiency.
- For instance, EM designs, values, provides audit support, and continually tracks Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) awards, which can be very unique depending on circumstances.  Although unique, there are multiple common steps and concepts that can be combined using OOP to increase the efficiency on the back end and front end of the service.
- Maybe a few more examples of EM's services and how it would benefit from OOP or why it benefits me to learn OOP.

## Overview of Monte Carlo Methods

- Benefits of MC - why is it so useful.  why even use it?  Where is the power?

### A Naive Monte Carlo Pricer



### Variance Reduction Techniques

- How can I implement Variance Reduction Techniques to imrove work, and why are these important in the case of EM.

#### Antithetic Sampling - 

#### Stratafied Sampling

#### Control Variate Sampling
